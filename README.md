# recursive-triangles
A program that draws a colored Sierpinski triangle using recursion. 
#
Menu options: *random colors* - toggles the use of random colors for each triangle instead of random colors for each stage; 
*triangle borders* - toggle the use of a white outline for each triangle.

The export will export a new .png file to your current folder. The file will be called saved.png and it will be overridden on a new export.
